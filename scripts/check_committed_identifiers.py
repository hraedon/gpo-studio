"""Mechanical gate against committing work-domain identifiers.

Two complementary checks:

1. Always-on (no configuration): no tracked file may live under ``samples/``.
   ``.gitignore`` is advisory — ``git add -f`` bypasses it — so this guard makes
   an accidental force-add of a real identifier-bearing data file fail CI. The
   ``samples/`` directory holds real environment data (hostnames, service
   accounts, principal handles) that must never be committed (AGENTS.md).

2. Secret-driven: when ``GPO_STUDIO_FORBIDDEN_IDENTIFIERS`` is set (a
   whitespace-separated list of real identifiers — hostnames, emails, service
   accounts, principal handles, personal names), every tracked text file
   outside ``samples/`` is scanned for those identifiers. This catches real
   names that leaked into docs, tests, or reflections. It is a no-op (exit 0)
   until the secret is configured, so it never blocks a fresh clone or a fork
   without the secret.

   **Multi-word identifiers are double-quoted** (``"two words"``) and match any
   separator run — spaced, hyphenated, underscored, dotted, or wrapped across a
   line break. Before this, the parser split unconditionally on whitespace, so a
   multi-word identifier could not be expressed at all: its halves became short
   tokens that the length filter dropped. A real two-word work-domain name sat
   undetected in sixteen repositories — eight of them public — because of that
   blind spot. Any denylist entry containing a space must stay quoted.

The denylist is resolved, in order, from:

1. ``$GPO_STUDIO_FORBIDDEN_IDENTIFIERS`` (already exported, e.g. CI);
2. ``<repo>/.identifiers-denylist.local`` (gitignored, per-repo);
3. ``~/.config/agent-suite/forbidden-identifiers`` (shared canonical set).

This mirrors ``githooks/pre-commit`` so direct invocation (CI, or a developer
running the script by hand) finds the same denylist the hook does. The hook
remains the canonical resolver; this is a fallback for when the script is run
without it.

**Fail-open by default.** With no denylist the gate exits 0, so a fresh clone
or a fork without the secret is not bricked. CI passes ``--strict`` to invert
that: a CI run whose denylist secret is missing or empty fails closed, because
"CI is the hard gate" is defeated the moment the hard gate silently no-ops.

``--strict`` also narrows the resolution above to source 1 alone. Sources 2 and
3 are files, and in CI a file is an input the branch under test can write: a
pull request adding ``.identifiers-denylist.local`` with one harmless token
would otherwise hand the gate its own denylist, and the gate would run, find
nothing, and report a pass. That is the original fail-open wearing a green
check. The repository secret is the only source strict mode trusts.

A consequence worth stating: a pull request from a fork receives no secrets, so
the gate fails closed there. For a private repository that is the intended
answer — an unreviewable denylist is worse than a blocked check.

Run in CI:    python scripts/check_committed_identifiers.py --strict
